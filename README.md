# Series Solutions to Differential Equations and Series Manipulations
## Abstract
This is a paper I wrote many years ago for a company called Solve and Integrate. They never published it 
and I kept the original since it's submmission in August 1990. My intention is to rewrite this and write the
code for it in either Haskell or Go.
 I am posting this to show that I came up with this method back in 1990.
